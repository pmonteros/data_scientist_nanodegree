# Data Scientist Nanodegree

This repository contains my progress associated with my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post

### The libraries used in this work correspond to

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
sklearn
seaborn

### Project Motivation

In the course of my career there have been several topics that have caught my attention. One of them corresponds to those associated with health. The idea of being able to use my skills to improve people's lives is something I am passionate about.

In this case, I decided to conduct a small study, which will be strengthened over time, associated with cardiovascular diseases. The database was obtained from the website kaggle and allows us to understand habits, and underlying diseases that would be associated with an increased likelihood of heart problems.

### File Description

The project consists of a simple notebook on which the code was developed.

### Medium Blog

The main findings were written in (https://medium.com/@pablo.montero.salvatierra/how-data-could-help-us-detect-cardiovascular-diseases-cb173c1a2f52) , which will be strengthened over time.
