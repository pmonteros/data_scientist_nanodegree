pandas
sqlalchemy
nltk
re
sklearn
pickle

### Project Motivation

In this project, I applied the skills learned in this course, particularly those related to 'Data Engineering.' The goal was to create a classifier to categorize real messages sent during disastrous events. Additionally, the project includes a web application with which it is possible to interact.

### File Description

This work consists of the following folders.

## app
- templates
  - go.html #classification result in app web
