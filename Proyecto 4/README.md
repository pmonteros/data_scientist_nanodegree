## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements

I want to express my gratitude primarily to the course for equipping me with the essential tools to develop my skills as a Data Scientist. Additionally, I'd like to thank ChatGPT, as it has enabled me to carry out the necessary translations, considering that English is not my native language.
